          Economics is the social science that studies how societies allocate
          <br> limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants and needs. It examines
          <br> the <b><strong>production, distribution, and consumption of goods
              <br> and services </b></strong>, as well as the factors <b><strong>influencing individual
              <br> and collective decision-making</b></strong> in the realm of scarcity.
          <br> Economics plays a crucial role in shaping public policy, business
          <br> strategies, and our understanding of global financial systems.

              <strong>lowest </strong></b>
            figures. The <b>USA</b> consistently
            maintains the <b>world's top GDP per Capita</b>, underscoring
            the fact that its residents enjoy access to a relatively
            substantial economic output and income, which serves as

            approximately 415 million, while the USA has surged to
            around 80,000 million in GDP per Capita. Nonetheless, it's
            noteworthy that GDP per Capita figures worldwide are
            generally exhibiting an <b>upward trajectory </b>, which is a

            The heatmaps reveal the investing patterns of 12 randomly chosen countries
            across various sectors. Despite <b>differences in their economic development
              levels</b>, these countries share a <b style="color: green;"><strong>strong</strong></b>
            emphasis on investing in <b>Public

            good health is essential for a nation's prosperity. A country's economic
            growth is hindered when its population's health is in decline, as it can
            lead to increased disease prevalence, higher mortality rates, and a reduced
            labor force, ultimately impacting the overall economy.

            The chart depicts annual changes in the unemployment rate,
            showcasing a generally <b style="color: green;"><strong>positive trend</strong></b> <b>of decreasing
              unemployment</b>,
            which is <b>favorable for the economy</b>. However, a significant and
            unexpected spike occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
            leading to an <b style="color: red">unprecedented increase</b><b> in unemployment</b>. Many companies

            Zooming in on <b>Africa</b> reveals a <b style="color: red;">starkly increasing trend</b> in unemployment,
            suggesting a persistent decline in the labor force. A higher unemployment

            contribute less to consumer spending, which is a key driver of economic growth.
            Additionally, it can strain social safety nets and government resources, further
            affecting GDP through increased public expenditure.

            experiencing the <b style="color: green;"><strong>most significant decrease </strong></b> among continents.
            The unemployment
            rate in Europe declined by approximately <b>5%</b>, while the global average decrease
            was only 2%. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Europe was the <b>least affected</b>
            in terms of unemployment rate, indicating a stable economy and effective national
            planning.

            The scatter plot illustrates the correlation between a country's GDP
            per Capita, Life Expectancy, and its Population. The data clearly
            indicates that as a country's <b>GDP per Capita increases</b>, so does its
            Life Expectancy. When we group countries by continent, it's evident
            that <b>Africa stands out with the </b><b style="color: red;">lowest </b><b>Life Expectancy and GDP per
              Capita</b>, likely due to the persistent impact of diseases leading to higher
            mortality rates and shorter life expectancies. This, in turn, hampers
            their economic development due to a lack of a productive workforce.

            <b>Asian</b> nations had <b>only marginally better statistics than Africa</b>. However,
            over time, their GDP per Capita has <b style="color: green;"><strong>risen to levels comparable to Europe

            often through exports, and changes in economic structures, supported by
            flexible economic policies when needed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since 1995, the data points have generally shifted from the bottom left corner
            to the upper right corner, indicating <b>improvements in both GDP per Capita and
              Life Expectancy</b>. Notably, there isn't a strong correlation between population

            spread across various data ranges.
