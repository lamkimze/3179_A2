            <p>The choropleth map shows the GDP per Capita across the world.
              <br>In overall, Americas are doing having the highest GDP per
              <br>Capita compare to other continent while Africa are having lowest
              <br>GDP per Capita. United States of America (USA) is always having
              <br>the world's leading GDP per Capita. This indicates people in USA
              <br>has access to relatively high amount of economic output or income
              <br>which is an important indicator of high standard of living. However,
              <br>there are a large gap between the highest GDP per Capita and the
              <br>lowest. Sierra Leone has only about 415 Million in GDP per Capita
              <br>in 2023 while USA had shoot up to about 80,000 Million in GDP per
              <br>Capita. However, the GDP per Capita around the world are mostly
              <br>having increasing trend which is a good scenario.

            <br> The stacked bar chart showing the GDP Composition
            <br> of top 10 countries. United States of America is
            <br> having a substantial lead in total economic output
            <br> compare to other countries which is more than 2,200
            <br> trillion USD. China, which ranked 2nd in total
            <br> economic output only has a total of 1,700 trillion
            <br> USD which has quite a large gap. However, from the
            <br> 3rd highest total economic output onwards, the gap
            <br> tends to be larger. Japan only has a total of 500
            <br> trillion USD which is more than 4 times lower than
            <br> US and more than 3 times lower than China.
            <br>
            <br> The composition is splitted into 3 main field which
            <br> are agriculture, industry and services. All the countries
            <br> are having a similarity, the service fields contribute
            <br> the most in all countries economic output. Service field
            <br> occupied the least in China which is about 50%. For other
            <br> countries, it occupied at least 70% of the economic
            <br> output.

            <br>The scatter plot visualize the relationship of GDP per Capita,
            <br>Life Expectancy and Population. From the plot, it is obvious that
            <br>when GDP per Capita of a country increases, Life Expectancy of that
            <br>country also increase. When grouping wih continent, Africa is having
            <br>the lowest Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita. This is most likely
            <br>that the there are various diseases had been ravaging Africa for a
            <br>long time which cause the high death rates and short life expectancy.
            <br>From that, they are always lack of people to develop their countries
            <br>and economic.
            <br>
            <br>Among all the continents, Asia countries are having the most obvious
            <br>increasing trend in life expectancy and GDP per Capita. In 1995, the
            <br>life expectancy and GDP per Capita of almost half of Asia continent

            <br>only slightly better than Africa. When time increase, the GDP per
            <br>capita of most Asian countries is already comparable to that of
            <br>Europe and the United States. Growth was driven by rapid
            <br>industrialisation, often led by exports and linked with changes
            <br>in the composition of output and employment. It was supported by
            <br>coordinated economic policies, unorthodox wherever and whenever
            <br>necessary, across sectors and over time.
            <br>
            <br>From 1995, the points started to move from bottom left corner to
            <br>upper right corner which shows the improve of both GDP per
            <br>Capita and Life Expectancy of countries. However, there are no
            <br>obvious relationship of population with life expectancy and GDP per
            <br>Capita. There are different population across different range of data.

            <br> In overall, the trend of life expectancy are increasing over year.
            <br> However, the increasing trend varies among different continent.
            <br> Africa is having the lowest life expectancy compared with other 
            <br> continent. It is the only continent that the life expectancy is 
            <br> always lower than 65 years. However, their life expectancy is 
            <br> growing rapidly. Its live expectancy increase from 55 in 2000 to
            <br> 63 in 2015 which is also the peak. The significant improve in life 
            <br> expectancy in Africa may mainly due to the improvement in health
            <br> service. There are large variety of diseases spreading in Africa
            <br> in past. The improvement in health service helps in protect them
            <br> and cure the diseases. However, the life expectancy of Africa is 
            <br> the lowest compared with other continent.
            <br>
            <br> The improvement in life expectancy in other areas, as observed in 
            <br> the chart, is relatively gradual and modest, with most continents 
            <br> experiencing an increase of only 2 to 5 years over time. This 
            <br> suggests that life expectancy has been improving steadily but at 
            <br> a relatively slow pace in these regions. This might due to these 
            <br> area had reached a stable developing stage in which the economic,
            <br> health care and demographic changes are already quite comprehensive.
